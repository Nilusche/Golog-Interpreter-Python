# Golog Interpreter in Python

This is an Implementation of Golog in Python.
Inspired by the paper [golog.lua: Implementation of Golog for Embedded Systems](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2010/2631/pdf/10081.Ferrein.2631.pdf) by Alexander Ferrein, I have tried to implement a golog interpreter in python.
I used the classical elevator problem as an example.

The code can definitely benefit from more documentation which will likely follow.
